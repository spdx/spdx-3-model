# SPDX 3 model

The Software Package Data Exchange® (SPDX®)
is a standard format for communicating information
about components associated with software packages.
It has wide industry adoption
as a standardized Software Bill of Materials.
It is also an ISO standard, ISO/IEC 5962:2021.

This repository holds the model for the information captured
on the (upcoming) SPDX version 3 standard.

## Branches and Formats

The editable files are written in a constrained subset of Markdown
and are stored in the `main` branch.

These files are automatically processed into regular Markdown
and placed in the `generated` branch.

People who wish to read the current version of the information
should be viewing the latter, while anyone wanting to edit
should be working on the former.
