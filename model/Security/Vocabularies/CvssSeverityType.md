# CvssSeverityType

## Summary

Specifies the CVSS base, temporal, threat, or environmental severity type.

## Description

CvssSeverityType specifies the CVSS severity type, defined in the CVSS
specifications as the textual representation of the numeric CVSS score.

The severity type entries are inclusive of and applicable to enumerations found
in CVSS versions
[3](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.0/specification-document#Qualitative-Severity-Rating-Scale)
and
[4](https://www.first.org/cvss/v4.0/specification-document#Qualitative-Severity-Rating-Scale).

CvssSeverityType is a mandatory field because baseSeverity is required in the
CVSS version [3.0](https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.0.json),
[3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v3.1.json), and
[4.0](https://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-v4.0.json) schemas.

The field can be used to document the base, temporal, threat, or environmental severity.
