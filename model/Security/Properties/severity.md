## Summary

The severity of a vulnerability in relation to a piece of software as expressed
in an CvssV3VulnAssessmentRelationship assessment.

## Description

A vulnerability's vector captures a number of factors that translate into a
numerical score used to quantitatively express the threat possed by it in
relation to a piece of software taking into account the CVSS base metrics in
addition to temporal and environmental factors. The severity field provides
a human readable string, a label that can be used as an English adjective that
qualifies the numerical score.
