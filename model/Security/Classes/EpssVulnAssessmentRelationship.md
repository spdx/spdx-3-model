# EpssVulnAssessmentRelationship

## Summary

Provides an EPSS assessment for a vulnerability.

## Description

An EpssVulnAssessmentRelationship relationship describes the likelihood or probability that a vulnerability will be exploited in the wild, and the percentile ranking of probability relative to all other vulnerabilities' EPSS scores, using the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) as defined at [https://www.first.org/epss/model](https://www.first.org/epss/model).

**Constraints**

- The relationship type must be set to hasAssessmentFor.
- The probability must be between 0 and 1.
- The percentile must be between 0 and 1.

**Syntax**
