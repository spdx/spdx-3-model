# EpssVulnAssessmentRelationship

## Summary

Provides an EPSS assessment for a vulnerability.

## Description

An EpssVulnAssessmentRelationship relationship describes the likelihood or
probability that a vulnerability will be exploited in the wild, and the
percentile ranking of probability relative to all other vulnerabilities' EPSS
scores, using the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) as defined at
<https://www.first.org/epss/model>.

**Constraints**

- The relationship type must be set to hasAssessmentFor.
- The probability must be between 0 and 1.
- The percentile must be between 0 and 1.

**Syntax**
