# licenseName

## Summary

Identifies the full name of a License.

## Description

A licenseName contains the full name of a License, preferably using the title found
in the applicable license text or file, or as otherwise specified by the
License's author or steward.

When no such title is specified, using a name from another well-known source or list
of licenses (such as OSI or Fedora) is suggested.

If no official or common name is known, any name may be used to aid in
distinguishing the License from other Licenses.
