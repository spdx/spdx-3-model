# ConjunctiveLicenseSet

## Summary

Portion of an AnyLicenseInfo representing a set of licensing information
where all elements apply.

## Description

A ConjunctiveLicenseSet indicates that _each_ of its subsidiary
AnyLicenseInfos apply. In other words, a ConjunctiveLicenseSet of two or
more licenses represents a licensing situation where _all_ of the specified
licenses are to be complied with. It is represented in the SPDX License
Expression Syntax by the `AND` operator.

It is syntactically correct to specify a ConjunctiveLicenseSet where the
subsidiary AnyLicenseInfos may be "incompatible" according to a particular
interpretation of the corresponding Licenses.
The
[SPDX License Expression Syntax](../../../annexes/spdx-license-expressions.md)
does not take into account interpretation of license texts, which is
left to the consumer of SPDX data to determine for themselves.
