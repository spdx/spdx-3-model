# seeAlso

## Summary

Pointers to where the License or Addition can be found in use.

## Description

A seeAlso defines a cross-reference with a URL where the License or
an Addition can be found in use by one or a few projects.

If applicable, it should include a URL where the license text is posted by
the license steward, particularly if the license steward has made available a
"canonical" primary URL for the license text.

If the license is OSI approved, a seeAlso should be included with the URL for
the license's listing on the OSI website.

The seeAlso URL may refer to a previously-available URL for the License or
LicenseAddition which is no longer active.

Where applicable, the seeAlso URL should include the license text in its
native language. seeAlso URLs to English or other translations may be included
where multiple, equivalent official translations exist.
