## Description

A package refers to any unit of content that can be associated with a
distribution of software.

Typically, a package is composed of one or more files.  

Any of the following non-limiting examples may be (but are not required to be)
represented in SPDX as a package:

- a tarball, zip file or other archive
- a directory or sub-directory
- a separately distributed piece of software which another Package or File uses
  or depends upon (e.g., a Python package, a Go module, ...)
- a container image, and/or each image layer within a container image
- a collection of one or more sub-packages
- a Git repository snapshot from a particular point in time

Note that some of these could be represented in SPDX as a file as well.
