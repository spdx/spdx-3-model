# NoAssertionElement

## Summary

An Individual Value for Element representing a set of Elements of unknown
identify or cardinality (number).

## Description

NoAssertionElement should be used if

- the SPDX creator has attempted to but cannot reach a reasonable objective
  determination;
- the SPDX creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or
- the SPDX creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning should
  be implied by doing so).

For example, a Relationship with
`relationshipType`="ancestorOf",
`from`=Element1,
and
`to`=NoAssertionElement
is explicitly expressing that
no assertion is being made about any potential descendants of Element1.
