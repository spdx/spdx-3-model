## Summary

A grouping of characteristics unique to a particular aspect of an Element.

## Description

An Extension is a grouping of characteristics unique to a particular aspect of an Element.
Extension acts as an abstract class basis for defining specific subclasses for characterizing some particular aspect of an Element. This supports custom extension of SPDX-3.0 in a structured fashion for specific adopting contexts, for agile evolution of practical use of SPDX-3.0, and for SPDX-3.0 internal specification of aspect characterization relevant across different Element subclasses.
