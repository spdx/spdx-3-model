# Relationship

## Summary

Describes a relationship between one or more elements.

## Description

A Relationship is a grouping of characteristics unique to an assertion
that one Element is related to one or more other Elements in some way.

To explicitly assert that no such relationships exist, the `to` property 
should contain the 'NONE' individual and no other elements.
A relationship that contains 'NONE' and additional elements in the `to` property is not valid.

To explicitly assert that no assertions are being made regarding the 
existence of such relationships, the `to` property should contain the 'NOASSERTION' individual.
