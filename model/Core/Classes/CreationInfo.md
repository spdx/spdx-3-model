# CreationInfo

## Summary

Provides information about the creation of the Element.

## Description

The CreationInfo provides information about who created the Element, and when and how it was created. 

The dateTime created is often the date of last change (e.g., a git commit date), not the date when the SPDX data was created, as doing so supports reproducible builds.
