# Contributing to the SPDX 3.0 Model

## General

SPDX is always welcoming new contributors!

The discussions are happening on the
[spdx-tech mailing list][spdx-tech-list]
and during our [regular meetings][meetings].

All the details are in: <https://spdx.dev/participate/tech/>

This repository consists of files written in
[a specific Markdown format][format] describing the model classes,
datatypes, properties, and vocabularies which will be used to automatically
create documentation, ontologies, and validation artifacts.
These are organized by profile.

Please submit [a pull request][pull-requests] or [an issue][issues]
for any suggested changes or issues you find.

Significant changes between versions should be logged to
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Contribution License Agreement

Contributions to this repository are made pursuant to the
[SPDX Community Specification Contributor License Agreement 1.0][cla].
You do not need to submit a signed copy of the contributor license agreement;
by making a contribution to this repo, you agree to the terms set forth in that
agreement.

## Contributing to a specific profile

There are multiple profiles being developed in parallel for the SPDX 3.0 model.

- During its initial phase of development, a profile working group will
  contribute changes to its own branch in this repository.
  - For example, any changes to the "Future Profile" should be submitted as a
    change request to the `future-profile` branch.
- There will be at least one maintainer per profile in charge of merging any
  profile development changes to the profile-specific branch.
- Once the first "complete" version of a profile is ready,
  the profile maintainer will alert the general SPDX tech group that the
  profile model is ready for review.
- Once alerted, the SPDX tech group will review and provide feedback.
- Once profile proposals have been reviewed and approved, the profile-specific
  branch will be merged to a general `development` branch along with the other
  reviewed profile models.
- Once the profile in `development` branch is stable, its code from the
  `development` branch will be merged to `main`.

At this point the SPDX tech team will re-evaluate the best way to continue
updating individual profiles.

This method of development was agreed upon by the SPDX Tech team on 2023-01-17.

## Translation

Translations of model descriptions are welcome.
Please see [translation.md][translation] for details.

## Profile Maintainers

In accordance with the development model described above,
each profile has at least one maintainer in charge of merging profile-specific
changes to the profile working branch.

To contribute to a specific profile, please open a PR to the profile-specific
branch or reach out to the maintainer of the profile (noted below).

Each profile in active development phase also has their own
[regular meeting time](https://github.com/spdx/meetings#sub-groups-for-specific-topics).
