# CBOR

Concise Binary Object Representation
([CBOR](https://cbor.io/), [RFC 8949](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html)) is a data format
designed to minimize both code size and message size for machine-to-machine communication. CBOR messages
are binary data but can be [displayed](https://cbor.nemo157.com/) in both annotated hex format
and a JSON-like diagnostic notation.
