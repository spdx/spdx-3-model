# JSON-LD Serialization

JSON-LD is a JSON-based format to encode RDF graphs.
Its documentation can be found [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/).

The JSON-LD is an RDF format and follows the serialization rules of the
[SPDX RDF serialization specification](rdf.md).

## SpdxDocument

The following SpdxDocument properties are mapped to native JSON-LD mechanisms
defined within the JSON-LD syntax specifications. Any properties not listed below
should be serialized as part of the SpdxDocument element itself within the
JSON-LD serialized data.

Deserialization of any JSON-LD serialized SPDX content MUST expand the inverse of
these native mappings such that the logical SpdxDocument element directly
contains its full set of properties.

### namespaceMap

The namespaceMap uses the [term to IRI mapping](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#example-11-term-expansion-from-context-definition)
in the [JSON-LD context](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#the-context).

### element

The [graph objects](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#graph-objects) `@graph`
lists the elements for the SpdxDocument.

The RDF graph of an instance of the SPDX model shall contain all Element nodes
(i.e. objects that are subclasses of Element) as a list on top-level under the
"@graph" key. This means that all references to Element nodes have to use the
URI of the referenced Element.

Inlining/Embedding of Element nodes into other nodes is not allowed.

On the other hand, non-Element nodes (like those of type "ExternalReference" or
similar complex data classes) have to be inlined (TODO: we may want to make an
exception for CreationInfo, depending on the outcome of the surrounding
discussion).

## Context File

The SPDX organization provides a global JSON-LD @context file that MUST be used
universally for all SPDX JSON-LD files of a given SPDX version.

The context is available under <https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.0/spdx-context.jsonld>
and should be included in serialized files on top-level via

```json
"@context": "https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.0/spdx-context.jsonld"
```

Take special note that this context defines aliases for better compatibility
with the SPDX model. In particular, these are "spdxId" for "@id" and "type" for
"@type".

Further custom namespace mapping can be included in the context in a separate
object, see for example [here](json_ld/examples/spdx_document4.json).

## Validation

An SPDX serialization in JSON-LD is considered valid if it validates against
the OWL ontology which also includes SHACL shape restrictions.

Read a detailed document on how to
[validating SPDX 3 JSON-LD documents](json_ld/validation.md), structurally and
semantically. The document also include a few tools that are known to work.

The OWL ontology is located at <https://spdx.org/rdf/3.0.0/spdx-model.ttl>.

The ontology is automatically generated by
[spec-parser](https://github.com/spdx/spec-parser)
from the
[specification markdown files](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/tree/main/model).

## Examples

JSON-LD serialization examples can be found [here](json_ld/EXAMPLES.md).
